# Fourier Neural Operator
This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [(FNO) Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)

In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.

It follows from the previous works:
- [(GKN) Neural Operator: Graph Kernel Network for Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03485)
- [(MGKN) Multipole Graph Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09535)


## Requirements
- [PyTorch 1.6.0](https://pytorch.org/)

## Files
The code is in the form of simple scripts. Each script shall be stand-alone and directly runnable.

- `fourier_1d.py` is the Fourier Neural Operator for 1D problem such as the (time-independent) Burgers equation discussed in Section 5.1 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf).
- `fourier_2d.py` is the Fourier Neural Operator for 2D problem such as the Darcy Flow discussed in Section 5.2 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf).
- `fourier_2d_rnn.py` is the Fourier Neural Operator for 2D problem such as the Navier-Stokes equation discussed in Section 5.3 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf),
which uses a recurrent structure to propagates in time.
- `fourier_3d.py` is the Fourier Neural Operator for 3D problem such as the Navier-Stokes equation discussed in Section 5.3 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf),
which takes the 2D spatial + 1D temporal equation directly as a 3D problem
- The lowrank methods are similar. These scripts are the Lowrank neural operators for the corresponding settings.
- `data_generation` is the conventional pseudo-spectral solver we used to generate the data for the Navier-Stokes equation.

## Datasets
We provide the Burgers equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation datasets we used in the paper.
The data generation configuration can be found in the paper.
The datasets are given in the form of matlab file. They can be loaded with the scripts provided in utilities.py.
